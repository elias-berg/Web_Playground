# Eli's Web Playground

My personal web playground. A collection of random little web-related projects of various stages of completion.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Node.js installed and run the base site with:
`node app.js`

Because this is a simple collection of projects, there's no real fancy Node logic...yet ;)

## Projects

### [Madison Hailstones](./MadisonHailstones/)

This was my from-the-ground-up rewrite of the entire [Madison GAA](https://www.madisonhailstones.com/) website. Unfortunately, it wasn't used for very long before the PRO took over and used a site like Wordpress instead.

The highlight of this project ended up being the Calendar that I wrote from scratch. It takes an input file indicating any recurring practices/events as well as one-off events and displays them. It's primitive, but could easily become its own project!

### [Super Mario Sunshine](./SuperMarioSunshine/)

This is a checklist I made for fun to track all of the shines and blue coins while I was playing through the game. I realized partway through, it makes for a great template as a starting place for a checklist-creation form. Otherwise, enjoy the aesthetics, that's pretty much all it's good for, unless you want to use it for your own playthrough!

### [Timelogger](./Timelogger/)

Back when I worked at Epic Systems, we had to log our time to the nearest 25-minute time chunk. It's an extremely tedious problem and the only solution coworkers were using was an in-house (but not very well known) app that would ask you every 30 minutes what you were working on for the past half hour. So I created that basic page and enhanced it over time to be *proactive* instead of reactive, where you log what you're about to work on, rather than recall what you previously worked on.

It's kind of a gross hack, I know I need to rewrite a lot of it to make it more legible, but at least enjoy the poem in the JavaScript. This project spawned another idea for a project to just track what your active window is so you can guesstimate how long you worked on stuff throughout the day (e.g. if I was using EMC2 for 3 hours, I was probably doing design work, etc.).

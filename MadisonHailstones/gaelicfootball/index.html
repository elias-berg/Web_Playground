      Gaelic football is a highly-skilled, fast-paced, and intense sport and has been described as a mix between soccer and rugby.
      It is played between two teams of 15 players on a large rectangular grass pitch with H-shaped goals at either end of the pitch.
      The objective is for players get a ball, roughly the size of a volleyball, up the field towards the opposing end.
      Players can use their hands or feet to hit the ball to pass to each other or to shoot for scores.
      Getting the ball past the opposing goalkeeper and into the net is 3 points, while kicking it over the bar, like a field goal in American Football, is worth 1 point.
      The players on each team typically have designated roles and positions which are: 1 goalkeeper, 6 defenders, 2 midfielders, and 6 forwards.

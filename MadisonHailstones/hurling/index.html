        Hurling is an all-male, fast-paced, high-impact field sport with soccer goals on either end of a large field.
        It uses a baseball-sized ball and players strike it with a stick while opponents use shoulder tackling and blocking to defend.
        You can score in by either hitting it over the crossbar for one point or the team can work the ball down the field and try and hit it into the goal for three points.
        All of the sports that are played growing up in America are found in hurling so people pick up the basics of the game in just a few minutes.

        The Hurling Club of Madison started in 2007 and is active for 9 months every year.
        The men start with an Indoor Season in January and have a highly competitive City League in the summer. 
        Throughout the year the hurlers travel to cities like Minneapolis, Chicago, and Indianapolis to play other clubs and participate in tournaments.
        We also travel to a national tournament each year and have won national championships in 2015 and 2019.
        The year finishes up with the annual Midwest Tournament held in September.
